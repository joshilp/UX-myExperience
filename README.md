# myExperience UX Design

This project conducts a **Nielsen's Heuristic Evaulation** on the overall usability of Simon Fraser University's myExerience, a web application that allows students to view and search for job, co-op, and event postings. After the evaluation, **Usability Tested Mockups** were created based on usability tests to determine a user interface that addresses the issues found in the evaluation.

Due to the size of myExerience, the scope of the evaluation was limited to the following screens:

* Homepage – Dashboard Tab
* Register for an Event Dialog Box – Co-Op Events Calendar
* Choose Event screen
* Register for an Event screens
* Search Postings Dialog Box
* Career Job Postings
* Search Results
* View Job Detail
* Apply for Job screen
* Upload Documents - Application Requirements screen
* Upload Document

After the evaluation, user interface mockups were created. Then usability tests were conducted with 5-7 participants for each design.

Due to the size of myExerience, mockups were limited to these key screens:

* Homepage
* Event registration (both before and after registration)
* Career or Co-op job postings, including basic search
* Search results
* Job details
* Job application form, including required documents
